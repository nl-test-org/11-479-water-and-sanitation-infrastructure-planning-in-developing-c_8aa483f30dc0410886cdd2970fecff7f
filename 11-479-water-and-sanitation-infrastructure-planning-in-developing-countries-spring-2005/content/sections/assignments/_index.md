Reading Journals
----------------

Each student will keep a journal of notes/short reflections on the assigned readings for the class. For each set of readings, the instructor will provide a short list of discussion questions to help students focusÂ their reading and prepare for the next class session. Students can, but need not, also use these questions as the basis of their readings journal entries. Note that this should not be a summary of the readings, but some of the students' own thoughts about the themes and debates of the readings.
