Course Description
------------------

In this course, we will examine the planning process for the provision of water supply and sanitation (W&S) services in developing countries. After a review of the state of water and sanitation services in different parts of the world and a brief introduction to W&S technologies, we will cover issues of service pricing, alternative institutional structures, including privatization, and the role of consumer demand and community participation in the planning process. Please note that the course is not technical in nature. Although we will become familiar with different W&S technologies, the emphasis of this course is on planning and policy processes in the sector. We will also examine environmental and public health considerations in water supply and sanitation planning, as well as strategies for serving low-income households. The course will make extensive use of case studies from Asia, Africa, Latin America, and Central and Eastern Europe. Assignments will include policy memos and a journal of notes on the assigned readings.

Assignments
-----------

Two policy memos (5 pages maximum) and 8 readings journal entries (~1 page).

### Description of Assignments

*   Each student will keep a journal of notes/short reflections on the assigned readings for the class. For each set of readings, the instructor will provide a short list of discussion questions to help students focus their reading and prepare for the class session. Students can, but need not, also use these questions as the basis of their readings journal entries. Note that these entries should **not** be a summary of the readings, but some of  **the students' thoughts** about their themes and debates. Journal entries should be written for each class session except those in which a policy memo is due. Journals will be read by the instructor on a weekly basis, and students can expect feedback on roughly one third of their entries. Students who are interested in discussing ideas from the readings, or regarding W&S planning and policy more generally are welcome to visit the instructor at any time.  
      
    
*   Policy memos are a unique written product that practitioners in the policy and planning fields should be able to produce. See the "Guide to Writing Effective Policy Memos" and the student examples in the [assignments]({{< baseurl >}}/sections/assignments) section.
